This will be a personal project of making a well-documented folder of data structures in C++ for future use. This should include both header files and method files for at least the following data structures:
Linked List (and linked list styles like stacks/queues)
  Singly linked lists
  Doubly linked lists
  Stacks
  Queues
Trees
  General Trees
  Binary Search Trees
  Red Black Trees
Graphs
Hash Tables
Heaps
